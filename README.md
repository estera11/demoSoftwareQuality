# Demonstrating Software Quality

## Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation

In order to estimate the difficulty of task I have used the Bucket System.
Story points rate the  effort of the work involved in a Fibonacci-like format:  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.. .
Regarding the priority the task are ordered based on their priority.

1. Create the model classes for Survey, SurveyResponse, Question ojects. Story Points: 2

2. Create the Controller class. Story Points: 1

3. Implement method to create new survey. Story Points: 2

4. Implement method that enables to add question to survey. Story Points: 2

5. Add method that displays list of all surveys. Story Points: 2

6. Add method to get survey by name. Story Points: 2

7. Implement method to create survey responses. Story Points: 2

8. Add method to display the survey responses associated with a survey. Story Points: 2

9. Calculate average for survey. Story Points: 2

10. Calculate standard deviation for survey. Story Points: 3

11. Get maximum and minimum score for a survey. Story Points: 3

12. Calculate standard deviation for a question. Story Points: 2

13. Get maximum and minimum score for a question. Story Points: 3

I have decided to assign 1 point to the 2nd task as it only involves th creation of a class and no testing. Starting from there as tasks get more complex and involve testing and other different steps I have decided to increase the story points. So for tasks like the 3rd and 4th I have decide to estimate 2 story points.
